### Correlation Analysis
![Correlation Heatmap](correlation_heatmap.png)

This heatmap visualizes the correlation between numerical features in the dataset:
Correlation insights:
- The provided correlation matrix offers insights into the relationships between three variables: **overall**, **quality**, and **repeatability**. Each coefficient indicates the degree to which one variable moves in relation to another. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the analysis:

### Correlation Coefficients Analysis

| Variables         | overall  | quality  | repeatability |
|-------------------|----------|----------|---------------|
| overall           | 1.000000 | 0.825935 | 0.512600      |
| quality           | 0.825935 | 1.000000 | 0.312127      |
| repeatability     | 0.512600 | 0.312127 | 1.000000      |

### Insights

1. **Strong Positive Correlation**:
   - **overall & quality (0.826)**: This strong correlation suggests that as the quality increases, the overall rating tends to increase as well. This indicates that improvements in quality are likely to have a significant positive impact on the overall perception.

2. **Moderate Positive Correlation**:
   - **overall & repeatability (0.513)**: The moderate correlation indicates that there is a noticeable relationship between overall ratings and repeatability. However, it is not as strong as the correlation between overall and quality. Enhancing repeatability could lead to improvements in overall ratings, albeit to a lesser extent.
   
3. **Weak Positive Correlation**:
   - **quality & repeatability (0.312)**: The correlation between quality and repeatability is relatively weak. This implies that while there is some relationship, changes in repeatability are not strongly linked to changes in quality. This suggests potential for independent improvements in these metrics.

### Actionable Recommendations

Based on these correlations, here are some actionable recommendations:

- **Enhance Quality**: Invest more resources into improving the quality of products/services. Since there is a strong correlation with the overall rating, enhancements in this area can significantly elevate overall satisfaction and perception.
  
- **Increase Repeatability**: While the correlation with overall satisfaction is moderate, enhancing repeatability can still positively affect overall ratings. Implement processes that ensure consistent outcomes to improve repeatability.

- **Monitor Quality Separately**: Focus on developing tailored strategies for quality and repeatability. Since the correlation between quality and repeatability is weak, improvements in one may not automatically yield benefits in the other.

### Conclusion

The correlation matrix suggests a prioritized approach focusing on enhancing quality to drive up overall ratings, while continuing to improve repeatability as an additional aspect that contributes positively but to a lesser extent. Regular monitoring and analytics should be conducted to adapt strategies as necessary based on these relationships.

### Outlier Detection
![Outlier Detection](outliers.png)

This boxplot shows the distribution of values for numerical features and highlights potential outliers
Outlier insights:
- To analyze outliers in a given dataset, we first need to understand what constitutes an outlier in the context of the data. Outliers are points that differ significantly from the rest of the data and can skew results or indicate variability in measurement. Below is a structured approach for analyzing outliers based on the context of your dataset.

### Steps for Outlier Analysis:

1. **Identifying Outliers**:
   - **Methods**: Common methods for outlier detection include:
     - Z-Score Analysis: Points with a Z-score greater than 3 or less than -3.
     - IQR (Interquartile Range): Points below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR.
     - Visualization: Box plots, scatter plots, and outlier plots often help in visual identification.

2. **Summary of Detected Outliers**:
   - Create a table or list summarizing identified outliers.
   - Include columns for the data point, the cause for outlier designation, and the relevant context.

   | Data Point | Z-Score | Cause for Outlier | Contextual Remarks |
   |------------|---------|-------------------|--------------------|
   | X1         | 4.5     | Exceeds threshold  | Could be a data entry error  |
   | X2         | -3.2    | Below threshold    | Might indicate an extreme case |
   | X3         | 5.0     | Exceeds threshold  | Could represent a rare event |
   | ...        | ...     | ...               | ...                |

3. **Examining the Impact**:
   - Analyze how these outliers impact statistical measures like mean, median, and standard deviation.
   - For example:
     - Calculate the mean and median with and without outliers.
     - Assess how the presence of outliers skews data distribution.

4. **Visualize the Data**:
   - **Box Plot**: Visualizes median, quartiles, and potential outliers.
   - **Scatter Plot**: Shows data distribution along axes to highlight outliers.
   - **Histogram**: Displays the frequency distribution to see how outliers affect the overall shape.

5. **Recommendations**:
   - **Validating Data**: Check if outliers are valid or result from data entry errors. 
   - **Deciding on Treatment**: 
     - Keep: If outliers represent natural variability or cases worth examining.
     - Remove or Adjust: If they are errors or impact the analysis negatively.
   - **Analytical Approaches**: Consider robust statistical methods that are less sensitive to outliers, e.g., median instead of mean.

6. **Document Findings**:
   - Conclude with a summary of important findings and how they will influence future analysis.

### Decisions Based on Findings:
- Reformulate hypotheses or models considering the implications of these outliers.
- Adjust future data collection or processing methods to minimize outcropping of outliers.

### Conclusion:
Understanding and addressing outliers is crucial. They can provide valuable insights into data quality, unexpected events, or errors in data processing and should be carefully analyzed in the context of the overall dataset.

### Insights

1. **Overall Ratings:**
   - The mean overall rating is approximately **3.05**, indicating a generally positive assessment.
   - The ratings are concentrated around the value **3**, as indicated by the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, which are all 3 or below.
   - With a maximum rating of **5**, there is room for improvement by pushing ratings higher.

2. **Quality Ratings:**
   - The mean quality rating is slightly higher at **3.21**, showing that respondents generally view quality more favorably than overall satisfaction.
   - Similar to the overall ratings, a majority of respondents rated quality at **3** or below, suggesting potential stagnation at this level.
   - The maximum quality rating is also **5**, which indicates that while good quality exists, it is limited to a minority.

3. **Repeatability Ratings:**
   - The mean repeatability score is only **1.49**, indicating that there may be significant issues with the ability for respondents to see value in repeat engagement.
   - A lower score (near minimum) implies that many respondents rated repeatability at **1**, which is concerning.
   - The max for repeatability is **3**, suggesting that repeated usage or experiences are not favored, hence potentially impacting customer retention.

### Recommendations

- **Focus on Improving Overall Quality:**
   - Since respondents have rated quality slightly higher than overall satisfaction, investigating the factors contributing to the quality ratings could help enhance overall ratings.

- **Increase Repeatability:**
   - A targeted strategy to improve the elements that lead to higher repeatability should be introduced. This might involve customer engagement initiatives, loyalty programs, or improved post-purchase experiences.

- **Customer Feedback Analysis:**
   - Conduct qualitative feedback sessions/workshops to understand why quality and overall scores are satisfactory yet do not translate into high repeatability. Use this feedback to identify specific pain points.

- **Leverage Best Practices:**
   - Investigate methods or strategies implemented by the top-rated entities (those giving scores of 4 or 5) to glean insights that can be replicated.

By implementing these strategies, there may be opportunities to enhance all three metrics and foster a more positive customer experience leading to potential increases in ratings.
