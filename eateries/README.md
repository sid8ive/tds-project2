## 2. The Analysis Carried Out
For this analysis, several statistical and machine learning methods were utilized. Descriptive statistics were computed to summarize key data attributes such as mean, standard deviation, and value distributions for the columns. A pairplot visualization was generated to examine relationships between variables visually.

Subsequently, KMeans clustering was implemented to segment the eateries into distinct groups based on their geospatial data. This dimensionality reduction technique helped in understanding clusters of businesses, allowing us to visualize how these eateries are organized geographically.
